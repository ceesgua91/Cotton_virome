# Cotton_virome
This repository contains putative viral contigs obtained from metatranscriptomics data of cotton samples collected in the Southern United States. 
These files contain putative viral contigs in FASTA format. Each individual file corresponds to putative viral sequences extracted from the raw reads deposited in the Sequences Read Archive database (SRA). A sample code was given to each file, which corresponds to the location from where the sample was collected. Code, sample names (location), and SRA accessions were assigned as follows:
